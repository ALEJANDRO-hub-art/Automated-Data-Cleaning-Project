📊 **Automated Data Cleaning Project**


📘 **Project Overview**

This project focuses on automating data cleaning and standardization within a MySQL environment using:

- Stored Procedures

- Events (scheduled automation)

- Triggers (automatic execution on data change)

The goal is to take a raw dataset (us_household_income) and automatically:

- copy it into a cleaned version
- remove duplicate records
- standardize inconsistent text values
✅ maintain ongoing data quality without manual effort
✅ allow future inserts to be processed automatically

The script builds a fully automated pipeline where MySQL handles data cleaning internally, reducing the need for external tools or repeated manual SQL execution. 

Automated Data Cleaning Stored …

🧩 Business Problem

Real-world datasets—especially large demographic or government data like U.S. Household Income—commonly suffer from:

duplicated rows

inconsistent text formatting

misspellings

structural issues

manual reporting delays

repeated cleaning effort

Without automation:

❌ analysts repeatedly clean the same data
❌ reports become inconsistent
❌ errors propagate into dashboards and models
❌ manual labor increases cost and time

The business need is:

👉 a reliable, repeatable, automated process that ensures the dataset is always clean and standardized before use in analytics, reporting, machine learning, or integration pipelines.
